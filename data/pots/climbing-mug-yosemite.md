This mug is part of a series of mugs that have a climbing theme. 

This one uses a pinch handle that mimics a climbing wall with a crack. The art on the mug shows popular views in Yosemite including the Dawn Wall and the Tunnel View.

{{DETAILS}}

### Process

The base mug was thrown out of *speckled buff*. 

Two narrow slabs of *chocolate* were then attached after the base mug had been trimmed to form the wall / crack / handle before being bisque fired.

The mountains and trees were then painted on with underglaze and colored slip.

This was finished off with a partial dip in *iron brownspot* and then dipped fully in clear.

### Mistakes

* Not a huge issue but the handle could have been waxed away before dipping in glazes to create a rougher surface to hold.
