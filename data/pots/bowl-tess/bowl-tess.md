A simple angular bowl with bright inner colors.

{{DETAILS}}

### Process

The base bowl was thrown with *BMix without Grog*. It was then trimmed to get the sharp angles. These angles break glazes in sometimes interesting ways. I'm also generally a fan of these clean lines and shapes.

After a bisque fire, the bowl was dipped in *Iron Brownspot* to to coat the outside. I poured *Blurple* to coat the insides. After this dried, I then poured a little bit of *Cobalt* to coat the bottom center in a brighter blue and dipped the rim in *Spearmint* and *Cobalt* as well.
