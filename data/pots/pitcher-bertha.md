{{DETAILS}}

### Process

I threw this pitcher out of the last of my *BMix without Grog*. I wasn't a huge fan of the proportions 

The handle is made out of a coil of clay (instead of being pulled -- because I hate pulling handles).

After bisque firing, I added rings of all the underglazes I had, then waxed over the painted area. The pitcher was then dipped in *Blurple* to coat everything else. 

### Mistakes

* I need to make / pull thicker handles. These thin / wirey handles aren't super comfy to hold.
