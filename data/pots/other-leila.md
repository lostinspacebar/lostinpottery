A tiny pitcher / pourer made out of porcelain. It has a heavy base and is good as a small pourer for, say, creamer.

### Process

This was my first piece thrown out of porcelain. In order to show off the clay itself, there is very little glazing. A small necklace motif is painted on with underglaze and then dipped in *Clear*.
