This is part of a series of cat mugs. These mugs have a basic thrown form that is then added to, 
including a tail that acts as a handle.

{{DETAILS}}

### Process

The base body was thrown out of *BMix with Grog*. Once leather hard, it was trimmed to clean up the edges. 

The eyes, nose, whiskers, ears and legs were added on with some slip. These are just shapes cut out of a piece of slab (of *BMix with Grog*).

The tail is a coil that I shaped into a tail and added on like any other handle.

The mug was then bisque fired. 

The glazing process here was the most interesting part of the mug for me. I hadn't layered glazes with wax before.

The eyes had a yellow colored slip with black underglaze for pupils. The nose was mix of black and red underglaze and the feet were some black underglaze. The aim of this process is to get black on the main body without having to paint it all on, i.e. just dip it. 

Once the underglazes were on, I painted these areas with clear and then with wax. This essentially seals in those colors behind the wax and then when I dipped the mugs in black underglaze, it coats the body but not these areas while still keeping them glossy. 

I had no idea if these would actually work or if some random glaze would run, but it worked out pretty well.

### Mistakes

* The tail handle could be thicker and shaped a little nicer for a nicer hold. 
* The inside of the cat has a heart painted on but masking it off with wax could have been done cleaner.
