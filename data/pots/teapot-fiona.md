This was the first teapot I made. Although a functional teapot, the spout doesn't pour as well as it should. 

This teapot is accompanied by two small cups.

{{DETAILS}}

### Process

The base body and lid were thrown out of *Speckled Buff*. After drying to leather hard, the body and the lid were trimmed together to make sure they fit.

The handle was made out of a slab of *Speckled Buff* and then shaped / trimmed to be more angular.

I did throw a spout for this but it did not look very good. Ended up building a spout out of a slab of *Speckled Buff* and it was an interesting aesthetic. 

After bisque fire, the teapot was very minimally glazed with some underglaze and then dipped in clear. The area under the lid was cleaned so it wouldn't stick to the body in the glaze fire.

### Mistakes

* The spout needs more of a lip so it pours better without a drip.
* I didn't clean the bottom of the lid well so I had to use a hammer and chisel to separate them after glaze fire.
