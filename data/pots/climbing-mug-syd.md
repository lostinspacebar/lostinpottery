This mug is part of a series of mugs that have a climbing theme. 

This one uses a pinch handle that mimics a climbing wall with a crack. The art on the mug shows popular views in Yosemite including the Dawn Wall and the Tunnel View.

{{DETAILS}}

### Process

The base mug was thrown out of *BMix with Grog*. 

The belay device was hand built out of a slab of *BMix with Grog*. It helped to have a physical device nearby to get the proportions close.

The handle was just a coil that was attached to the base mug along with the belay device after trimming.

The handle and belay device were underglazed while the mug was leather hard and bisque fired.

The handle and belay device were dipped in clear and waxed. The whole mug was then dipped in *spearmint* and *iron brownspot*.

### Mistakes

* The base mug is a little small to really be a coffee mug.
* The *iron brownspot* layer didn't add much to the *spearmint* and could probably be omitted.
