A donut with a serious headache.

{{DETAILS}}

### Process

The original donut was thrown out of *Chestnut*. This took the least amount of time.The rest of process was handbuilding with the same clay.

*Chestnut* allows for some good handbuilding but moisture management was key. The teeth were first to be added. These were just solid chunks of clay shaped and slip/scored onto the inner ring of the donut.

Each of the feet were modeled and then attached to legs. After these set a bit, they were slip/scored onto the donut. 

The eye was a blob of clay that was first slip/scored onto the donut and then shaped with a flat wooden tool.

The head was first cored out roughly then pulled apart by hand to create the effect of being ripped open. The donut walls are a little less strong after doing this because we are breaking the seal that kept it balloon-like before.

The hands were built separately and slip/scored onto the head. They were mostly build in a neutral grab but then shaped into place around the head wound walls. *Chestnut* is bendy enough to allow this without cracking if you go slow. 

Details like nails on the feet and the fingers really make things creepier. Knees and finger joints are also more on the pointy side -- closer to how a spider's legs might look.

Chains were the last to go on. These were the simplest part of the process.

For glazing, most of the donut is underglaze with a simple clear coat brushed on top. The inside is coated with *Clear* as well so the vase can have water in it. 

### Mistakes

* The feet on the back are reversed but like, it's a monster. It doesn't live by any real rules.
