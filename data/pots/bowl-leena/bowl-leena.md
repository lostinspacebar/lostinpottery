A simple medium sized bowl.

{{DETAILS}}

### Process

The bowl was thrown with *Chocolate* and trimmed when leather hard. I generally like angled / clean surfaces.

After bisque fire, *Blurple* and *Cobalt* were poured into the center bowl. This combo of glazes spits out the metallic bright blue color I've been enjoying for insides of my pots. The lip side of the bowl was then dipped in *Yellow*. The rings at the bottom are *Jade* and *Electric Blue* underglaze.
