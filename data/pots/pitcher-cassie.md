A speckled pitcher with simple lines and minimal accent colors. 

{{DETAILS}}

### Process

I threw this pitcher out of *Speckled Buff*. This clay is quite pretty by itself so I don't find the need to add too much in the way of glazes. 

The handle is made out of a slab of clay (instead of being pulled -- because I hate pulling handles).

After bisque firing, I added a simple rim of *Jade* underglaze and dipped the bottom in *Iron Brownspot*. The whole pitcher was then coated in *Clear* glaze and fired.

### Mistakes

* The bottom half could have been more balanced visually.
