A larger space for chips and a small inner bowl for your dip. Or do it the other way around. Or fill it all with dip and just scoop it all out with your hands. Do whatever you want. I'm not a cop.

### Process

The main outer bowl was thrown with a marbled combo of clays - *Speckled Buff* and *Chocolate*.

The inner bowl was hand built out of a slab onto this bowl when it was leather hard.

After bisque fire, *Blurple* and *Cobalt* were poured into the center bowl. This combo of glazes spits out the metallic bright blue color I've been enjoying for insides of my pots. The bowl was then dipped in *Clear*. The marbled swirls from the two clays are interesting enough visually that I find it unnecessary to do much with these.
