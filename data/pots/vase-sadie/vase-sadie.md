A small vase. This was the first vase-ish things that I threw as a potter. 

{{DETAILS}}

### Process

This was thrown out of *BMix with Grog*. 

After bisque fire, *Spearmint* was poured into the vase with some overflow on the lip. The outside was dipped in *Shiny Black*. 

### Mistakes

* I always seem to have a little trouble getting *Shiny Black* to get on my pots in a consistent manner. Some areas on the pot are thinner and rougher.
